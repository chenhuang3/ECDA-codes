On Stampede2, the CPUs on login node and job nodes are different. If we use "-xHost", we will have the "illegal instruction" error. 
To avoid these CPU instructions, we manually set the FCFLAGS and CCFLAGS. Following is for KNL nodes. 
As suggested by TACC (https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede2#building-performance-architecture), here is the configuration


./configure FC=gfortran CC=gcc --with-dft-flavor=bigdft+libxc FCFLAGS="-O2 -march=knl" CCFLAGS="-O2 -march=knl"
