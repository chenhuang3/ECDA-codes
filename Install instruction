On Stampede2, the CPUs on login node and job nodes are different. 
If we use "-xHost", we will have the "illegal instruction" error. 
To avoid these CPU instructions, we manually set the FCFLAGS and CCFLAGS to avoid "xHost".

./configure FC=ifort CC=icc --with-dft-flavor='libxc+bigdft' FCFLAGS="-O2"  CCFLAGS="-O2
