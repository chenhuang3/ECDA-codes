On Stampede2, the CPUs on login node and job nodes are different. If we use "-xHost", we will have the "illegal instruction" error. 
To avoid these CPU instructions, we manually set the FCFLAGS and CCFLAGS. Following is for KNL nodes. 
As suggested by TACC (https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede2#building-performance-architecture), here is the configuration


./configure FC=ifort CC=icc --with-dft-flavor=bigdft+libxc FCFLAGS="-O2  -g -extend-source -vec-report0 -noaltparam -nofpscomp  -xCORE-AVX2 -axCORE-AVX512,MIC-AVX512"  CCFLAGS="-O2 -g -extend-source -vec-report0 -noaltparam -nofpscomp  -xCORE-AVX2 -axCORE-AVX512,MIC-AVX512"
